<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p class="Intro">Throughout this article, I will explain to you what martial arts are. I will then go on to teach you about some of the different types and the disciplines involved in these incredible methods of combat. Martial Arts are taught for Defence only. It is a discipline that is to be respected and must never be abused.
The term ‘martial arts’ doesn’t actually have roots in East Asia, but it does in Europe. The term martial art means ‘art of mars’. Mars is the roman god of war. There are different types of martial arts and they have different strategies involved with them. Different strategies are more beneficial for different circumstances and goals. For an example, if you are looking to learn how to grapple and how to fight on the ground; focussing on locks and chokeholds, then you should probably consider Brazilian Jiu Jitsu (BJJ). 
<br>
<br>
After reading this article, maybe you will consider learning a martial art.</p>

<h2>Different styles of Martial Arts</h2>

<a name="Brazilian Jiu Jitsu (BJJ)">
<h3>Brazilian Jiu Jitsu (BJJ)</h3>


<p class="BJJ">Brazilian Jiu Jitsu is a Brazilian martial art that specializes in grappling, body locks and ground work. It involves putting your opponent on the ground and using locks and chokeholds to maintain the dominant position. BJJ was developed around 1920, by Brazilian brothers Carlos, Oswaldo, Gastão jr., George, and Hélio Gracie after Carlos was taught traditional Kodokan Judo in 1917. BJJ is mainly about fighting on the ground and staying there and locking your opponent so they cannot move or attack you.</p>

<h3>Judo</h3>

<p class="Judo">Judo is a Japanese martial art that was created in 1882 by Jigoro Kano. The origins of judo are based around Jiu Jitsu. Like Jiu Jitsu, the main idea of judo is to ground your opponent and lock them in a choke hold to maintain the upper hand throughout the fight. The word judo means ‘gentle way’. The main aim of judo is competition where you have to score points by throwing or pinning your opponent to the ground. A judo practitioner is called a "judoka", and the judo uniform is called "judogi". Judo has also influenced other styles of combat, like ‘MMA’, ‘shoot wrestling’ and ‘submission wrestling’ because of the main idea of grounding your opponent. </p>

It was created in the 1940’s and 50’s by Korean martial artists who had experience in karate and other Chinese martial arts. Taekwondo vitalises defence from hands and feet at any time. No weapons are used in taekwondo. The art of taekwondo, as much as it is for physical development and achievement, it is also about the mentality and ideology that you possess.

It is a more powerful martial art that consists of punches, kicks, knee strikes, and elbow strikes.

<a name="Kung-Fu">
<h3>Kung Fu</h3>

<p class="Kung Fu">Kung Fu, (also known as Chinese martial arts), is a group of several hundred fighting styles that have been developed long ago in greater china. from the umbrella of Kung Fu, we get fighting styles such as shaolin Kung Fu, tai chi, Wing Chun and chi gun. some of the styles are different from others but in all of them, you move in a circular motion when fighting. some of the greatest martial artists in the world like Bruce Lee, Jackie Chan, Ip man and Jet li, all learnt styles of Kung Fu and became masters. Bruce Lee created his own style of Kung Fu called Jeet Kune Do; which is a hybrid style of Kung Fu, which uses speed against your opponent when they are going to attack. it is a part of Kung Fu that has been adapted by the personal ideology and experiences of Bruce Lee. Weapons such as nun chucks and Bo’s are also used in JKD.  </p>

<a name="Boxing">
<h3>Boxing</h3>

<p class="Boxing">Boxing is a western contact sport and martial art where 2 people wear protective gloves (most of the time) and fight in a ring for a number of 1 to 3 minute rounds. The fight involves punching the opponent from the waist and above. Boxing is a sport where you gain belts when you beat someone. If you beat someone who has a belt, then you will acquire their belts and their titles. Boxing is a sport in the Olympics. The industry of boxing contains large sums of money. A boxing match is overseen by a referee. As well as being an Olympic event, boxing has its own championships. the matches are divided in to weight divisions; flyweight (48-50kg), bantamweight (52-53kg), featherweight (55-57kg), lightweight (58-61kg), welterweight (63-66kg), middleweight (69-72kg), light heavyweight (76-79kg), heavyweight (90kg +). These are the weight divisions in boxing. Boxing is one of the oldest sports because it was taken part in during the time of the ancient Greeks with the very first Olympic Games.

<img src="CAPOEIRA PIC 2.jpg" height="200px" width="120px">
<a name="Capoeira">
<h3>Capoeira</h3>

<p class="Capoeira">Capoeira is a Brazilian martial art that uses dance, music and acrobatics to create a style of combat. It was first practised in the 16th century by enslaved Africans in Brazil. The art usually consists of kicking and dodging. It uses more fluent and graceful movements instead of rigid stances and set movements in other martial arts. A practitioner of capoeira is called a ‘capoeirista’. Interestingly, when the enslaved Africans were practicing capoeira, the dance and the music was used to disguise the fact that they were practicing fighting otherwise it would have been prohibited. After slavery was abolished in Brazil, capoeira was made illegal at the end of the 19th century. By the 1920’s authorities declared capoeira legal again.  Later on, martial artists began to use the capoeira techniques in their practises and it was taught. Capoeira requires one of the highest levels of core strength in order to complete the moves. Capoeira is probably one of the most flexible martial arts. Because of the origin of capoeira, it does not really have a ranking system but your rank depends on your skill level and your amount of experience in doing it. Capoeira can use weapons because of its origins. Weapons such as knives and blades are sometimes used during capoeira for slashing and stabbing, though what happened to the martial arts?
<br>
<br>
In capoeira, all of the movements and techniques revolve around a few movements (when performed together) are called ginga. It involves moving side to side whilst being bent forward and moving your legs back; switching places each time; as seen in the gif image beside.</p>

Kickboxing originated from japan in the 1960’s. Later on, in the 1970’s American kickboxing began and became important in September 1974. Kickboxing can sort of be considered as a hybrid style of combat because of the mix of various martial arts. Kickboxing is a more aggressive martial art that consists of many different types of strikes like elbows, knees, punches and kicks. There are different types of kickboxing from different parts of the world. It also varies from full contact to semi contact matches.
